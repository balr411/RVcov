Title: Rare-Variant Aggregation Testing Using Externally Estimated Covariance
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Brady Ryan
Maintainer: Brady Ryan <balr@umich.edu>
Description: Package that estimates single-variant score statistic covariance 
using a VCF from an external reference panel, and calls RAREMETAL to perform 
rare-variant aggregation testing. Package is also able to perform our two-stage 
approach of first performing the rare-variant aggregation test using the null
covariance, and repeating it only if the -log10(p-value) is above some threshold.
